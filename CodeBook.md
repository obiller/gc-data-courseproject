## Notes on Raw Data Source

The input for our script, run_analysis.R, is data generated by accelerometer and gyroscope sensor sygnals embedded in smartphones and a certain set of transformations applied to the data in an attempt to recognize different human activities. The complete details describing all the steps in the generation of what "Raw Data" would be for our purposes is described [here][1]. At a high level we have two sets of data, namely "train" and "test". Each of them carries information on participant, activity and various measurements generated for each activity. There are 561 of those measurements that are of interest to us.

For detailed interpretation of the Raw Data see features_info.txt, features.txt, activity_labels.txt and README.txt files that are a part of the getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip file when unzipped. The file can be obtained from [here][2].

## The nature of the Tidy data set
We seek to perform the following steps

1. Combine "train" and "test" data sets

2. Select only columns that have to do with **mean** and **standard deviation** measurements. We do this by examining the variable names and choosing only those containing the relevant keywords. This also allows us to reuse the column names as they are in the Source data and write more general and concise code.

3. Summarize the data by participant and activity and produce only **means** for the summarized data. Our resulting columns in final tidy data set are as follows:

* *subjectId* - an identifier for a participant, values from 1 to 30
        
* *actLabel* - activity description, taken directly from activity_labels.tx. values are WALKING, WALKING_USTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

* The rest of the columns are **means** generated for each *subjectId*, *actLabel* group. They are
